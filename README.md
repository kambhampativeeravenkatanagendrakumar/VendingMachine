# VendingMachine
Implementation of a Vending Machine using Mealy and Moore in Verilog

This project is designed to handle product dispensing when the money is above 25Rs

Project Highlights

   Dual FSM Implementations
   
   This project features both Mealy and Moore Finite State Machine (FSM) models, enabling direct comparison of their         design and behavior within the same vending machine application.

   Real world application
   
   The vending machine controller exemplifies essential digital design principles such as state transitions, user            input handling, and transaction logic.
